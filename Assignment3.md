ASSIGNMENT 3

## Demon Slayer Corps — The String Hunt

## String matching in practice: Naïve · Rabin-Karp · KMP · Finite Automata

In memory of Akaza, Upper Moon Three. It is only fitting that Assignment 3 is his.

Due: Sunday 8 November 2026, 11:59 PM

## Orders from headquarters

Congratulations, you survived Final Selection and joined the Demon Slayer Corps. A demon is hiding among the villages, someone in the Corps is cheating, and the Hashira want to know which technique is fastest. Your sword this time is the string matching: naïve, Rabin-Karp, KMP and finite automata.

Clear three missions and hand in a short mission report. All data files and the Python starter code are in DemonHunt_data.zip on the GCR. The starter code is in Python; if you prefer C++ or Java, port it yourself.

Start here. The starter code already reads the files, times your runs and tests your work. Your job is to turn the lecture pseudocode into working code: fill the TODOs in starter/matchers.py, run python test_matchers.py until every line says PASS (your own Final Selection), then complete mission1.py to

mission3.py.

## Corps rules

- Language: C++, Java or Python.

- No built-in substring search or regex inside any matcher. Using one in a matcher scores zero for that matcher.

- Report each match as its shift s, exactly as in the lectures (0 ≤ s ≤ n − m). In Python this is simply the index where the match starts, e.g. ababa with aba gives 0 and 2.

- Code is checked for similarity with other submissions and online sources. Copied code scores zero for the whole assignment, as per course policy.

- A 10-minute viva may be held. Students who cannot explain their own code or trace their own π and δ may have their marks scaled down.

## The three missions

## Mission 1 — The Crow’s Alarm (KMP) · 30 marks

Every slayer’s Kasugai crow reports to headquarters, and all their messages are in crow_log.txt (about 5 MB). When a crow spots a demon it screams KAKAKA. Headquarters needs to know how many alarms were raised.

- Report how many times KAKAKA appears and its first 10 shifts. Overlapping caws count: KAKAKAKA holds 2.

- The catch: the message scroll is too long to open at once. Read it only in 4 KB chunks. A caw split across two chunks must still be heard, so carry the KMP state q from one chunk into the next.

- Print the π array of KAKAKA as part of your output.

## Mission 2 — Tamayo’s Blood Lab (finite automaton) · 30 marks

Tamayo has isolated a marker that only demon blood carries: GATTACAGATTC. The folder blood_samples/ holds blood DNA from 10 villagers (about 1 million bases each). One of them is a demon in disguise.

- Build the δ table for the marker over Σ = {A, C, G, T} and print it.


- Run the automaton on every sample and unmask the demon.

- The catch: DNA has two strands, and this demon is clever. The marker may sit on the reverse strand only. Also search for the reverse complement (swap A↔T and C↔G, then reverse the string). Report matches per strand for every sample.

## Mission 3 — The Copycat Slayer (Rabin-Karp) · 30 marks

The Hashira asked five trainees, Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Kanao and Genya, to write about what they learned. Someone found hashira_manual.txt and copied from it. Their reports are in trainee_reports/. Find out who copied, and how much.

- Clean every text: lowercase, remove punctuation, single spaces.

- Hash every 40-character window of the manual into a hash map (hash → list of shifts), using d = 256 and q = 1,000,000,007. Roll the hash across each report; on a hit, verify character by character.

- For each trainee, print a similarity score = copied characters ÷ report length, as a percentage, and rank all five.

- The catch: one trainee changed words while copying. In two lines, explain why your detector gives them a lower score than they deserve.

## Bonus mission — Breathing Styles Tournament · +10 marks

Optional, for those who want Hashira rank. Race all four techniques (naïve, Rabin-Karp, KMP, automaton) in one arena with mission4.py.

- Arena (Infinity Castle): T = a repeated 100,000 times, P = a repeated 99 times followed by b.

- Show the comparisons and time of all four in one bar chart, and explain the winner and the loser in 3 lines.

## What to submit

Upload one zip named RollNo_DemonHunt.zip containing:

- src/: your completed starter folder.

- mission_report.pdf: 1–2 pages with a screenshot of each mission’s output and your two-line answer from Mission 3. Add the bonus chart if you did it.
